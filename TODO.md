- Service refactor to organize better the code
- Implement HTTPS security option
- Implement feature to read/write more bytes than what the MTU allows
- Log in a better way than println
- Add params to allow bash args input like timeout, service name etc
- Implement multiple requests based on device ID (like obj UserRequest that contains each Vec, then a HashMap<BLE_UUID, UserRequest>)
- Check if a request is already running
- Modify the way how the service is closed (now it closes when press enter)
